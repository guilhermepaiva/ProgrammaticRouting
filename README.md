# Programmatic Routing in SwiftUI

A demonstration project showcasing programmatic navigation in SwiftUI using a custom router pattern. This project implements a healthcare management system with separate navigation stacks for patients and doctors, demonstrating advanced routing techniques in SwiftUI.

## Key Features
- Custom router implementation using Swift's @Observable macro
- Multiple independent navigation stacks (TabView + NavigationStack)
- Type-safe routing with enum-based navigation
- Programmatic navigation without using NavigationLink
- Clean architecture separating routing logic from view code

## Technical Highlights
- Built with SwiftUI
- Uses the latest Swift concurrency features
- Implements environment-based dependency injection
- Demonstrates best practices for navigation state management

## Use Case
The project simulates a medical facility app with separate sections for patient and doctor management, making it a practical example for developers looking to implement complex navigation patterns in their SwiftUI applications.

## Requirements
- iOS 17.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
